## Position Property

<br />

<h3>position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky).</h3>

## properties
<ul>
    <li>static: An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:</li>
    <li>relative: An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position</li>
    <li>fixed: An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled</li>
    <li>absolute: An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).</li>
    <li>sticky : An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.</li>
</ul>
